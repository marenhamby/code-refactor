# code-refactor

This code is to load the Horiseon marketing website. I worked on it to try and clean up the html and css files to be more clean and to fix a bug which limited correct functioning of the page. 

This project was a good example of how using distinct element tags can clean up both the html and the css files so they are less cumbersome and complex.
